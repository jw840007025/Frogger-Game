# Frogger-Game 

_Description_

This is a spin on the classic frogger game.  Avoid getting hit by a bug and reach the water.  Once the player accomplishes this, a point will be added; however, if the player gets hit by a bug, a point will be subtracted.  PLay as long as you wish!  

_Control_

In order to move the player, use the arrow keys on your keyboard (left, right, up, and down).  


## Install
